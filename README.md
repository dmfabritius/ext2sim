# File System Simulation

This is a partial simulation of the ext2 file system. It is based on the code provided by
Dr. K. C. Wang, professor of Computer Science/Engineering at Washington State University (WSU),
in his book _[Systems Programming in Unix/Linux](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Programming-Unix-Linux-K-C/dp/3319924281)_
for the course [CptS 360 Systems Programming C/C++](https://catalog.wsu.edu/General/Academics/Courses/CPT_S).

Using the original C code as guide, I have rewritten the simulation in C++ to better align with
the university's prerequisite Data Structures courses. As closely as possible, I have kept
the same basic architecture and program logic as the original program in order to make it easier
to compare the C and C++ versions.

This is for educational purposes only. It is not intended to be production-ready code and only
serves as an introductory example of object-oriented programming and basic systems programming.
